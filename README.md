# Work-Day-Scheduler

This is a starting idea for a work day scheduler.

# Description

When you open the page you see the heading to the site and today's date

As you scroll through, you will see the time blocks scheduling out your 9-5 work day.

The blocks themselves are color coded in 3 different colors based on when the event is scheduled to happen, is happening right now, or one that already happened

When you click on the text blocks, you can enter your task and if you look into the Dev Tools in the application section, you can see that each event is saved in Local Storage, even if you refresh the page.
